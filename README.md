ðŸ”­ I work for a fintech company.   
ðŸ’» Mainly used technologies are Java, Spring, SpringBoot, RDBMS (Mysql, Maria, Oracle) and libraries based on them.   
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, NoSql, Node JS   
âš¡ If I bored while studying Java, study new technology.   
âœ¨ I usually exercise in the morning and study for an hour in the evening. Also, on weekends, I tend to study with my friends.
